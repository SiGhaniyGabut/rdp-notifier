# RDP Notifier for Windows
---

> Built with Ruby 3.1, UltraMSG API, and NGROK

RDP Notifier is a simple script to notify newest Hostname and Port when your PC/Server turned on, or restarted. This will send you a message to your WhatsApp number using UltraMSG API.

Since free plan NGROK always regenerate Hostname and Port whenever agents restarted, this script will send you a message with the newest once.

Using NGROK means you can remote PC **WITHOUT** port forwarding (on your router). This can be useful, more secure than exposing your PC through internet, and less-pain if your **ISP block some ports!** (like my ISP).
